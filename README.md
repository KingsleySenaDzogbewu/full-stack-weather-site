This is an improved version of my previous frontend-only weather website. 
Now with a backend powered by Node.js and Express, it fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays making it more dynamic and scalable.

Deployment
Frontend
- Hosted on Netlify
- Handles UI and user interactions

Backend
- Hosted on Render
- Handles API logic and external API communication

Communication
Frontend sends HTTP requests to backend API endpoints to retrieve weather data.

Tech stack
Frontend:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Backend:
